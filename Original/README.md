This folder contains as many of the original Genesis installs, documents and presets as I've found over the many years of tracking bits and pieces down.

Do you happen to have anything we don't? Contact me!

## Common

#### GenesisMF - "Mini Flare"

A restricted freeware plugin used to drum up interest in the more feature-complete version; *GenesisMF* is a Video Post plugin that renders one of 8 bundled lens flares at a chosen object position.
